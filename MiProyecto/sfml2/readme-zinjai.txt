This folder contains a set of minimun necessary files to build and run an sfml-2.x application. 

All files where obtained directly or compiled from SFML-2.4.2's sources (http://www.sfml-dev.org/files/SFML-2.4.2-sources.zip). Compiled files where produced with the gcc version distributed with zinjai (gcc 6.3.0 from mingw32), and compiled throught cmake with default options. In order to compile SFML it was neccesary to compile OpenAL first, wich was also compiled from source (http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal-releases/openal-soft-1.18.1.tar.bz2), with the same compiler, also throught cmake with default options. 

Additional html reference obtained from http://www.sfml-dev.org/files/SFML-2.4.2-doc.zip.

See the original SFML2 licence in "license.txt" file, and go to http://www.sfml-dev.org/ for more details about the library.
